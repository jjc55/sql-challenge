# sql-challenge
Module 9 Challenge

In this challenge, I worked in pgAdmin4 using structured query language (SQL) to analyze employee information for Pewlett Hackard. I started by doing some data modeling. I developed an entity relationship database (ERD) after looking at various excel sheets. Then, I performed data engineering and created tables and imported CSV files into the tables. Later, I analyzed the data using SQL and my results of this analysis are within this repo.
